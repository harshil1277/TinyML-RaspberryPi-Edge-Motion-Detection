# Edge and Motion Detection on Raspberry-Pi 4

## Introduction
Raspberry-Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry-Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. These can be used for smale scale end-to-end applications such as Object detection, face recoginition ,etc. with help of TinyML such as Tensorflow-lite and OpenCV. We can run pretrained models on Raspberry-Pi with ease. 

In this project, we have shown one such application of **Edge and Motion Detection** using Canny algorithm and python-opencv.

Hardware used:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (Raspiab Buster OS)
- Web Camera (USB) or picamera
- Display and micro HDMI cable
- Keyboard and Mouse (Optional)

The detection will provide output in form of video streams as follows:
- Original video
- Compensated video
- Grey Video
- Edge video

We also output frame rate (fps) and Motion detected on Thonny IDE terminal. You can follow us the demo video for the same. 

It provides a frame rate of around 12 fps.

## How to Run
- Setup Raspberry-Pi (Connect display and pheripherals) 
- Install and Setup OpenCV in Raspberry-Pi
- Open _main.py_ in Thonny IDE and click on Run button

Thankyou!
